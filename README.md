The **"Ubuntu Releases"** project is a Python script that automates the process of listing and downloading specific versions of Ubuntu directly from the official website. Here's a detailed description:

### Code Description
The script offers the following functionalities:
1. **Listing Available Versions:** Using the `BeautifulSoup` library, the script accesses the official Ubuntu releases page (`https://releases.ubuntu.com/`), extracts, and displays the available versions.
2. **ISO File Download:** Allows the user to select a version to download the corresponding ISO file, displaying a visual progress bar with the `tqdm` library.

### Key Components
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Displays Ubuntu-themed ASCII art, lists the versions, and guides the user to choose which ISO to download.
- **HTTP Requests:** Uses the `requests` library to access online information and manage file downloads.
- **Download Management:** Downloads files in chunks, updating the progress bar to allow the user to track the status.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `tqdm`

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip`.
3. Run the script to list and download the desired versions.

The project is a simple, efficient, and practical solution for users who need to download specific versions of Ubuntu in an automated way. It is licensed under the MIT License and is open to contributions.
